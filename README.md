  <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model</strong><br>
  A data-driven approach to understanding and predicting forest fires in Algeria.
</p>

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the  dynamics of forest fires in Algeria, using a data-driven approach to both understand and predict these natural phenomena. The aim is to utilize the power of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning to extract valuable insights from historical data and to develop predictive models that can forecast forest fire occurrences based on meteorological conditions.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository, providing a rich set of variables including temperature, humidity, wind speed (Ws), rain, and other environmental factors recorded over specific periods.
